The code in python file is related to a todo-AI app which takes help of Chatgpt to give suggestions related to task set by user. It gives advice to do task more efficiently. 

Kindly tell me how i can improve my coding skills. 
Suggest me features. 

NOTE- Code is not tested due to very less computation resource in my laptop. But anyone can create frontend and tell me to add more features.
